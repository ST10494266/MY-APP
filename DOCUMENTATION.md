# Hera's Meal Helper - Technical Documentation

## 1. Introduction

Hera's Meal Helper is an Android application developed to assist users in making meal decisions based on the time of day. The application provides personalized meal suggestions for different periods: morning, mid-morning, afternoon, mid-afternoon, dinner, and after-dinner desserts.

## 2. Technical Implementation

### 2.1 Development Environment
- Android Studio Hedgehog | 2023.1.1 [1]
- Kotlin Programming Language v1.9.0 [2]
- Android SDK 34 [3]
- Material Design Components v1.11.0 [4]

### 2.2 Architecture
The application follows the standard Android application architecture with a single activity design pattern [5]. The implementation is based on the recommended Android architecture components [6]. The main components include:

- User Interface (UI) Layer
- Business Logic Layer
- Data Layer

### 2.3 Key Components

#### 2.3.1 User Interface
The UI is implemented using ConstraintLayout and Material Design components [7], following Android UI best practices [8]. Key features include:
- Text input field for time selection
- Suggestion button
- Reset button
- Result display area

#### 2.3.2 Business Logic
The application implements time-based meal suggestion logic using Kotlin's when expressions [9], providing different meal options for each time period. The implementation follows clean architecture principles [10].

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Time-based Meal Suggestions
The application categorizes meals into six time periods, following nutritional guidelines for meal timing [11]:
- Morning (Breakfast)
- Mid-morning (Snacks)
- Afternoon (Lunch)
- Mid-afternoon (Snacks)
- Dinner
- After dinner (Desserts)

### 3.2 User Input Handling
The application processes user input using Material Design's TextInputLayout [12], ensuring:
- Input validation
- Case normalization
- Whitespace trimming
